All you have to do is press 'x' if the camouflage first triangle and grey second triangle match orientation. 
Press 'z' if they do not match. 
This response should be as rapid as accurate as you can be after you see the grey triangle.  

After this you will asked about how certain you were in your decision (1=Guessed, 2=Fairly sure, 3=Certain).
This second response is not timed. Just choose what you intuitively felt, don't overthink it. 

Leave fingers of each hand on each button for quick responses.

The first triangle will be cued as to which side the target triangle is going to appear on. 

REMEMBER!: Although it is tempting, always look at the central fixation cross. We are assessing your 
ability to make decisions on what you can see in you peripheral vision (edges of you vision). 

PRESS SPACE TO CONTINUE: Experiment will start after 6 seconds to give you time to get you fingers 
comfortable on the keys.
